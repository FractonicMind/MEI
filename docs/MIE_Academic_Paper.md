Mathematical Identity Encoding: A Steganographic Method

Author: Lev Goukassian

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for steganography. The proposed system, called Mathematical Identity Encoding (MIE), embeds binary data within a grid of mathematical expressions. In this system, a binary '0' is represented by a literal zero, while a binary '1' is represented by any mathematical expression that resolves precisely to the value of one. This approach transforms a secret message into a format that appears to be a mathematical exercise or abstract notation. We will define the encoding rules, analyze its formal properties, and explore its potential applications in digital watermarking, user authentication, and computational education.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional steganography and cryptography often rely on complex algorithms to conceal or scramble data. This paper explores an alternative approach: hiding information not through algorithmic complexity, but through a disguise of conceptual complexity. We propose a system that encodes binary data within the universal and formal language of mathematics.

The method has undergone several iterations. An initial version relied on simple additive expressions and numerical approximations to represent binary states. While functional, this approach lacked the precision required for a robust system. The final, refined method presented here is built on the rigorous principle of mathematical identity, where a binary '1' can be represented by a varied spectrum of expressions that resolve exactly to one, such as (70), (∣−1∣), or (0!). This ensures absolute precision and reliability in the encoding.

## 2. The Encoding Method: Rules and Principles

Mathematical Identity Encoding (MIE) is governed by a simple set of rules, making it both easy to implement and creative in its application.

    Grid Format: Data is arranged in a grid. For encoding standard text, this is typically a grid with 8 columns to represent 8-bit ASCII characters, with each row corresponding to one character.

    Representing a Binary '0': A binary zero is represented by the simple digit 0.

    Representing a Binary '1': A binary one is represented by any mathematical expression, contained in parentheses, that evaluates exactly to 1.

The power of this method lies in the infinite variety of expressions that can be used for a binary '1'. This allows the encoded message to have a high degree of randomness, making it difficult to detect for an untrained eye. For example, all of the following can represent the bit '1': (2-1), (√1), (sin²(x) + cos²(x)), (5÷5).

## 3. Key Properties and Analysis

MIE is not designed to replace traditional encryption but to serve a different purpose. Its main properties are:

    Steganographic Strength: The method's primary strength is its ability to conceal the existence of a message. The grid of expressions looks like a student's math homework, a programmer's test data, or an abstract design. An observer is unlikely to suspect it contains a hidden message.

    Low Data Density: The trade-off for this technique is low data density. It takes a significant amount of text to encode a small amount of information. This makes it unsuitable for large files but effective for short, hidden messages like a signature or a key.

    Computational Simplicity: The logic is simple to program. A script can easily generate thousands of mathematical identities to encode a message, and decoding is a matter of evaluating each expression and checking if the result is 1.

## 4. Potential Applications

The unique nature of MIE lends itself to several creative applications beyond simple secret messages.

    Digital Watermarking: An author, artist, or scientist could embed their name or a unique ID within a document or dataset using this method. The watermark would be hidden in plain sight, ready to be revealed by anyone who knows the secret.

    Creative Authentication (CAPTCHA): MIE can be used as a "proof-of-thought" system to verify a user is human. A server could present a small MIE puzzle, and only a user (or sophisticated bot) that can correctly decode the binary message would be granted access.

    Educational Tools: The puzzle-like nature of MIE makes it a perfect tool for education. A game could challenge students to find the hidden message, reinforcing dozens of different mathematical principles in an engaging and rewarding way.

## 5. Conclusion

Mathematical Identity Encoding is a novel steganographic method that leverages the language of mathematical truth to conceal information. Its strength lies not in algorithmic obfuscation but in conceptual disguise. By encoding data as a series of verifiable mathematical identities, it provides a functional and elegant system for hiding information in plain sight, with potential applications in security, verification, and education.
