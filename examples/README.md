### Examples

This folder contains simple scripts that demonstrate how to use the MIE encoder and decoder. Each script is designed to be a standalone example, providing a clear illustration of the core concepts.

-   **`encode_message.py`**: A simple script that uses the MIE encoder to convert a text string into a mathematical puzzle.
-   **`decode_message.py`**: A simple script that takes a pre-encoded MIE message and decodes it back into the original text.
